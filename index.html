		<p class="quote"> Absolutely fantastic! Learnig with Code Fun created an enevironment and ambiance that made the tough aspects of codifn so easy to walk thorugh. With just a few strokes of Code Fun Magic, I had grasped most of the difficult concepts of Frontend design with CSS and other frameworks. Even a s a pro, I will still like to have sessions with Code Fun as bootcamps along my career growth.</p>
		<p class="author"> - Daniel Okoh</p>
		<p class="quote">I never understood why people took time off to study with COde Fun as I had labelled it as one of these everyday Bootcamp sessions. But I got dragged to one free practical <em>Code Fun Hackathon</em> and ow I ceased to be a spectator. This is a transforming way to learn how to code. The next generation will definitely love coding because of you guys.</p>
